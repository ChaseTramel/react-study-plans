# Learning React

## Introduction

This study plan focuses on learning React and related concepts. Each module starts with explanations of the importance of each topic, followed by learning objectives. Then, sources like guides, books, and tutorials are provided to support learning. Finally, for each section the plan, questions are included that might be asked in an interview to demonstrate one’s understanding of each topic.

The practice exercises involve concurrently building four React applications oriented around my interests and skills, listed in projects-plan.md. Students should develop their own projects integrating their hobbies and pre-existing knowledge.

By following this study plan, learners can develop the necessary knowledge and skills to start building interactive user interfaces using React and build a strong foundation for learning advanced topics in React development.

This study plan assumes you have a basic to advanced understanding of HTML and CSS.

## JavaScript Fundamentals

### Importance

React is a JavaScript library, so a strong foundation in JavaScript is essential. Understanding variables, data types, loops, functions, and other core concepts is crucial. All subsequent topics rely on these fundamentals. Without a grasp of basic JavaScript, understanding advanced topics becomes challenging.

### Goals

Understand the core concepts of JavaScript, including variables, data types, and operators, and be able to write basic JavaScript code. Demonstrate a solid understanding of control flow structures (if statements, loops) and how to use them effectively in JavaScript. Explain the importance of functions in JavaScript, and create functions with parameters, return values, and local scope.

### Reflection

- Can you explain the concept of variable scope in JavaScript and how variable hoisting works? Provide an example to illustrate your explanation. How does understanding variable scope and hoisting help in writing efficient and error-free JavaScript code?
- JavaScript often relies on asynchronous programming to handle tasks like AJAX requests and timers. Can you describe what callback functions are and how they are used in JavaScript? Provide an example of a scenario where you've used a callback function to manage asynchronous operations.
- Front-end development frequently involves interacting with the Document Object Model (DOM). Can you explain how JavaScript can be used to manipulate the DOM elements on a web page? Provide an example of a situation where you used JavaScript to dynamically modify the content or structure of a webpage.

## ES6+ Features

### Importance

ES6 and later versions introduced many features that make JavaScript more powerful and readable. Features like arrow functions, destructuring, and classes are commonly used in React. These features simplify React code and are often seen in React codebases, making them essential to understand.

### Goals

Master ES6 features such as arrow functions, template literals, and destructuring, and apply them in practical coding scenarios. Gain proficiency in using let and const for variable declarations and understand their scoping rules. Be able to use ES6 classes and modules for organizing and structuring code.

Please provide an example of a situation where you made this decision and how it influenced your component's architecture.
- One of the key advantages of component architecture is reusability and modularity. How do you ensure that your components are reusable across different parts of an application or even in different projects? Can you share an example of a highly reusable component you've designed and how it contributed to the overall project architecture?

## States & Props

### Importance

States allow components to create and manage their own data, while props allow data to be passed between components. They are fundamental to component interaction and data flow in a React application.

### Goals

Differentiate between props and state in React and their respective use cases. Implement stateful and stateless components and manage their data appropriately. Demonstrate the ability to pass props and manipulate state within a React application.

## React Component Lifecycle

### Importance

Lifecycle methods dictate the phases a component goes through during its life in an application, from mounting to unmounting. Lifecycle methods can interact with states, props, and other components. They are essential for managing side effects in class components.

### Goals

Learn the various phases of a React component's lifecycle and when each is invoked. Implement lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`. Use the component lifecycle effectively for data fetching and cleanup operations.
